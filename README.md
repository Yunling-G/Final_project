ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in November 2022. The final project is a sentiment analysis about ChatGPT tweets which was made using NLP (Natural Language Processing). 

The main goal of this project is to get useful insights.  For instance, how people feel about ChatGPT; if more people like or do not like ChatGPT; what words are most frequently used for each sentiment. In addtion, an application called 'Sentiment Generator' is created to test if your comment about ChatGPT is good or netural or bad through the best selected model (Logistic Regression model).

In my modelling part, I mainly build three models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayers) and compare them to select the best model according to their prediction performance.


## Data
The dataset is collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charunisa/chatgpt-sentiment-analysis).

The tweets about chatgpt were collected for a month.

Columns:
- 'tweets': the reviews about chatgpt
- 'labels': good/bad/neutral
##  App: Sentiment Generator
This app is easy and friendly. 

You only need to write your comment about ChatGPT and then it will generate the semtiment (good or neutral or bad) automatically.
